My first project on Web FrontEnd.

I learn and use HTML5, CSS and JS for this INSTAGRAM page.

View the page from Evironment on repository's right side!

You can test { 

search box & header profile click event,

post double click event (Liked animation),

post like & store icon click event,

}

pretty funny and learned a lot.
Thanks.
